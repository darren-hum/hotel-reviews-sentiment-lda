Very convenient if you want to be centrally located but not splash out on accommodation. You save a lot of taxi money by just walking to places. The reception is very small. We noted a lot of bags at reception when we booked in and later learnt that if you check out early you can leave your bag and collect later. Our room was not ready when we arrived but the staff were happy for us to leave our bags to explore the city. We were hungry and we walked around to find somewhere to eat and Funan mall came in handy. The rooms are very small and can be difficult to manoeuvre if you have luggage. For a hotel this quality however they were'"
